Lurked around here but it's my first time posting. With the recent SEC decision that ICOs are to be considered securities, I imagine we will see a big reduction in the number of ICOs occuring (however the ICOs we will see will be regulated which is good for protecting us individual investors from the likes of Bitconnect etc).

As Ethereum is the largest platform for ICOs atm - what do you reckon the impacts of the SEC/regulation of ICOs in general will be on it? We'll certainly see fewer ICOs on the platform, but maybe quality over quantity is good in the long run?

I'd be interested in hearing from those who know more about how ETH is tied to the many ICOs on the Ethereum platform than I do (which is very little!)

/u/shazow's come up with an experimental [`vipnode`](https://vipnode.shazow.net/) implementation a while back. (The [initial announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethdev/comments/85l52t/having_trouble_connecting_with_geth_in_light_mode/) over at /r/ethdev didn't see much traction.)

This is a much ~~simpler~~ more down-to-earth approach than some other suggestions I've seen, as it doesn't involve payment channels, metering, off-chain negotiation, or other starry-eyed frills.

I've been using it myself (possibly the only paid customer?..), and it's worked flawlessly so far; got to wait a week more, though, until the final call: to verify that a subscription expiring correctly boots me off the ""VIP"" list. :)

Compare this to a `lightserv` node that I'm running myself: even with the client's address being written down in the ""static routes"" list, the server consistently fails to pick the client up; I'm guessing since it's overwhelmed by the near-thousand other clients that it has to maintain a connection with.

No? I agree, that would be completely unworkable. So there would need to be some kind of cut-off what will be restored and what not. This is the dangerous part. Who will decide what should be restored and what should not? How do we prevent these entities from being bribed or extorted? Again, a blockchain where extortion and bribery is possible is not useful to me.

And that is not the only issue with that. There are more nuanced and indirect consequences of such a system. The fact that only some funds will be restored, because they are worthwhile (hundreds of millions vs a single dollar) means there will be a preferential treatment by definition. And this will bring forward a “too big to fail” mentality. Assume for a moment there is party A that runs a smart contract for multisign wallets and is the largest by far. Then party B comes with a new smart contract for multisign wallets. People like how it’s used, however, why should you use this new smart contract that is dealing with much less funds? Due to preferential treatments and “too big to fail” mentality it would be better to use an older, perhaps even inferior version, simply because it is dealing with larger amounts of money and hence in the event of lost funds, there is a greater chance they will be bailed out. This would then be a very strong force that leads to monopolies (centralization) and upholds these monopolies.

This “too big to fail” mentality reminds me one thing: Banks. And not in a good way. Please, for the love of Blockchain, let’s keep such a mentality away from Ethereum. We need real, workable and sustainable solutions: Formal third party code audits. If Parity had done their due diligence this would never have happened. And I agree, even with formal audits, things like these might still happen. So let’s solve this in a fair way: Insurance. Decentralized insurance funds could easily work for insuring against these kind of code bugs. And they’ll bring about loads of other positives: They will probably enforce code audits, or they refuse to insure a smart contract. They can be used by large parties, but also by smaller parties, hence no preferential treatment. And most importantly, disputes will be handled between the insurance fund and the affected party, instead of being handled at Ethereum’s base layer, which brings decreased immutability for everybody.",Mushoz,46,46,0,False,0

The promise of the blockchain is to build trustless systems that are immune to failures of human politics no matter how big they get.

Breaking immutability is disastrous, especially in this way, because you introduce into the mix human politics. Introducing human politics can be necessary at some level, but not at the root level - as it makes the whole blockchain seem untrustworthy. For some projects or systems you want some governance, but some services need to be totally trustless - and it makes it impossible. Every project can only as trustless and immutable as the main chain is. You can build a governance model into your contract or side chain, but you can't unbuild a governance model that is in the main blockchain itself.

The main issue here is trust. When mechanics behind computation are as brutal and context-free as the laws of physics, then there is no distrust. The moment you have any kind of human politics you introduce distrust. Will some recovery committee be more likely to bail out somebody they know? How will you even know or prove that there is corruption there?  If you work hard to design secure code and your competitor gets bailed out when they make a lousy mistake, are you incentivized to write better code or get the right connections? This is just a tiny appetizer of skepticism, distrust and drama this introduces.

Immutability for everybody is the best scenario, because it is the simplest heuristic and keeps the main blockchain maximally trustless. It allows services to fine-tune their governance model instead having to trust politics of the main blockchain. It's a much simpler talking point and a much more distinct line to draw. We need to make it so that breaking this immutability has the same perception as dropping a nuclear bomb somewhere. You don't want to set those precedents. When that happens, it's very big news and everybody's eyes are on this event, closely scrutinizing it.

If some governance mechanism is needed, perhaps it can be at the contract level or side chain level. If you want your service to be able to recover from catastrophic bugs and human mistakes, you can wrap your service in another contract that simply delegates calls and can hotswap to another contract in the case of an emergency using some mechanism (like tokenholders voting to approve the fix). You can have very complicated logic behind it, with any combination of parties (devs, legal firms, tokenholders) and any number of permissions (veto, fast-forward, delay, or approve fix). Each project might require a unique governance mechanism and it's logical that only the community surrounding that project will be involved in it.",TheJonManley,1,1,0,False,0
